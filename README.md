## Estimating Broadband's Social Rate-of-Return (ebsr)

In this repo, code is developed to estimate the costs of connecting new 3G and 4G broadband users.

This data can then be used in econometric modeling of current and future broadband adoption, to estimate the societal benefits of providing universal broadband. 

### Setting up and running the code

reate a conda environment called `ebsr`:

   conda create --name ebsr python=3.7 gdal

Activate it (run this each time you switch projects):

    conda activate ebsr
